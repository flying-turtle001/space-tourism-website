## My process

### Built with

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - React framework

### `npm run develop`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

### What I learned

I used this project to further develop my skills and knowledge in React.

Since I have been interested in the React framework [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for a long time, I use this project to get started with Gatsby. It was important for me to use as many features of Gatsby as possible.

Since this project was a website with multiple pages, I was able to gain experience with routing. In addition, I also use Gatsby plugins, such as the plugin [gatsby-plugin-web-font-loader](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-web-font-loader/) to integrate Google Fonts into the website.

For the styling of the website I decided to use CSS Modules. This allowed me to give each component its own style without running the risk of influencing other components with the CSS. This approach was also a good exercise to improve my CSS skills and also to apply modern CSS layout features like Flexbox.

I also put a lot of emphasis on component-based development. Therefore I tried to split the website into as many single components as possible. For example, I developed a custom and reusable "Tabs" component with functions to jump back and forth between individual tabs.

To practice working with third party packages, I decided to use [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) for the sliders in the project.

All in all, the main thing I learned from this project was how to implement professional screen designs and design systems using React and Gatsby. I also learned a lot about Gatsby and in general about React and its ecosystem.
